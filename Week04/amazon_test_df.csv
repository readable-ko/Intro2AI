 on 24 May 2015 "," My daughter had bought the appropriate VTech InnoTab Max the previous week for her son's birthday, I bought the Toy Story software to go with it, which had a sticker on it stating it worked with the InnoTab Max. However when we tried it on his birthday, a message came up on the screen saying the software wasn't compatible, despite it saying on the packaging that it worked with ALL the VTech InnoTab. I discovered that the hardware had to be updated, and therefore had to download the update before the Toy Story software could be used. (I found this info purely by chance on another review site) I considered the information on the game misleading, saying it would work with ALL InnoTab - and it didn't,  and my grandson was hugely disappointed.

After playing it several times we have realised that some of the answers relate to different questions and some are totally incorrect so not much chance of learning. Buy it if you want to get frustrated. Whoever created this game does not know their general knowledge!, "

 on 6 Feb. 2012 "," Ok this didn't cost a lot but never-the-less this was useless as a game. I ended up using it to design a quiz but even then some of the answers are so obvious it would be insulting to a 5 year old. It doesn't come in a storage 'tub' as the picture appears to show, so the pieces are all loose. The whole thing went straight into the bin after I did my quiz! "

 on 24 Feb. 2015 "," I bought 2 of these for my grandsons for christmas and BOTH unfortuantely where smashed to bits when they opened them. I have not been able to return them due to the fact that the boxes along with packaging were  thrown away during the present madness of small children plus my grandsons live a long way away so could not easily get them back to me to return , which meant it cost me more money to purchase something else for both of them.Had they been in new condition then they would have loved them.

Not what I need in a D&D fight.Other dice have paint splatters on edges that has eaten into the plastic.Apart from the damage I ordered them coz I thought they would look cool but in the wrong light they are a pain to read

 on 4 Dec. 2015 ", Sadly quite cheaply made. Very little detail and plasticy. I've also bought the bmw superbike from maisto and that is similar.Looks good from a distance however as I have them on a window sill. But that's beyond the point. 
DAMP FIRE ,2.0, 12 Jan. 2012 , 1 of 1 people found the following review helpful ," THIS WAS A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT.THE PLASTIC LADDERS FALL APART IF YOU TOUCH THEM.THERE ARE 4 STABILISERS ON IT,2 OF WHICH SLIDE OUT WITHOUT TOUCHING THEM AND 2 WHICH ARE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO MOVE.VERY POOR QUALITY AND DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE £20+IT COST.£5 WOULD HAVE BEEN CLOSER TO THE TRUE VALUE.STEER CLEAR UNLESS IT'S FOR PART OF A COLLECTION.

 on 12 Dec. 2014 "," The cards are for my nephew for Christmas as he's just gotten into these things - there is a good mix of cards (though 2 rapidash's, but at least different versions), but I was a little disappointed to see that some of them are very scuffed up. I won't panic too much as for a 9 year old it wouldn't take long to get scuffed anyway (though still not great for a gift!) but this item would not be great if your a collector and want mint condition "

 on 5 Sept. 2011 "," Great case for great price. My only gripe here is that the image of this product is very miss-leading.Ultra Pro changed their case a couple of months ago and the old version (a better version if you ask fans around the world) is hard to come by.The old version has a soft ""foam"" inside where everything fits snugly.... as shown on the image for this product.The new Version has a stiff cardboard inside where the card boxes rattle around a little and you also wonder how long this cardboard will hold, before starting to fall apart.As you might expect, it was the new version that was delivered, even though the image shows the old one./wolf "

 on 28 Nov. 2013 "," This is not really a review of the Keldeo tin, as that was not the tin we received. No, we got a different one, which my child had already, and it was not clear when I bought the tin that it would be selected at random from a group. I would not have bought it if I had known that I could not specify which one my child wanted!Having said that, the seller then offered various options, and I received a full refund after some emailing. I don't have a problem with the way this seller works, I just think it should be clearer at the point of purchase. "

Interesting calendar that isn't generally available in the UK ,4.0, 8 Dec. 2013 ," By
    
    Ms. A. Barker
  
 on 8 Dec. 2013 "," I admit it, I'm an adult who is a fan of Playmobil. Despite having no kids, every year my partner and myself buy a Playmobil advent calendar each and we have a lot of fun opening them every day on the run up to Christmas. My partner has the Pirate Treasure Cove calendar this year.This year I decided to get this slightly unusual calendar as I hadn't seen it for sale anywhere else. It's available from Playmobil's German site but not from their UK one (though this may well change in future years). I like dragons and fantasy stuff like that, and this calendar looked completely bonkers with a dragon, two knights in full armour and weaponry, a ballista thing that shoots bolts across the room, some treasure and a magic dwarf shooting lightning from its hands. What's not to like?As it is only Dec 8th I've only opened a few windows so far but we both found that the items that we received in our calendars would allow a child to start playing immediately - day 1 gave us both a figure, the next few days gave us accessories for the figure and we both got a larger item on about day 6 so we didn't feel fobbed-off with getting tiny accessories all the time. I think a lot of thought has gone into the ""timing"" of each item in the calendars.As for quality, everything is up to Playmobil's usual standard. Some items require you to assemble them so children may need a hand with this, though they're more fiddly than complicated. The boxes come with a nicely-printed cardboard diorama so you can display your collection as you open the calendar and receive the items. "
