 on 7 Jun. 2015 "," The one star review is to get your attention and has nothing to do with the functionality of this pool: it's actually great. The padded floor is a fantastic idea and the sides are good and supportive for little ones when inflated fully. My big issue here is that the second ring down, the yellow one, is absolutely plastered, all the way around, with a stupid health & safety notice in every language on the planet, and probably a few beyond, contrary to the image shown above. We ordered this pool rather than the cheaper all-blue one because we thought it looked pretty, with it being multi-coloured. The safety warning utterly ruins that. Had I bought it from a shop I could have easily returned it to for a refund I would have done so. For the value of the pool, however, I couldn't be arsed with the re-packing and returns palaver. "

 on 8 July 2013 ", We really liked the look of this paddling pool & it looked like it fitted the bill with a good rating.  I never buy products with a poor rating & always read the reviews so I thought we were on to a winner with this product.  It was fantastic on the 1st day and our 3.5 year boy and his friends had great fun playing in and around it.  We then put it away carefully but the next time we used it was full of holes and the air came out of it as fast as you tried to pump it up!  Such a great idea but steer clear- it will just cause a great deal of disappointment and it's hard to explain to a little boy that he can't play in his pirate ship :(

I have taken delivery of two of these and have yet to be sent one that actually works let alone perform all the marvellous tricks it's supposed to do.  I am no space scientist but I have an engineering background and would consider myself generally competent.  I lost the first hour gingerly unpacking the robot, digesting the manual and double-checking while the robot blinked aimlessly but did nothing else.  After another hour spent changing the batteries and checking online for meaningful advice I contacted Amazon and arranged a replacement.  As you can guess, this involved repackaging the toy and trailing down to the Post Office.  After a week I received a replacement which lo and behold was completely lifeless.There is nothing to suggest this toy has been subject to any form of testing or quality control.  I refuse to believe that this experience is unique to me and that the sellers are unaware of the problems.  Do not reply to me asking if I have used reputable/fresh batteries and are they in the right way round.This item should work OUT OF THE BOX FIRST TIME.

Within 3hrs of the balloons being blown up, they started to deflate. By the morning they were down. What started to be a nice surprise turned out to be a complete flop!!!

Eventually he got frustrated and tried to open it from the side without using the hinges on top.

None of the stickers have come off yet, but I have only played with it for 10-15mins, I don't think they will last for more than an hour's actual play time.Solving the cube is harder than with a normal 3x3x3 cube as all the colours are the same and you have to figure out which shapes go where, if you don't mind the build quality then it will be entertaining and make you think in a different way that the normal cubes.Overall a neat cube which has been let down by it's build quality.

The chessboard is made of a square of thin chipboard covered in wafer-thin veneer. My chessboard arrived without a box or cover - just wrapped in lots of bubble wrap and parcel tape! Upon unwrapping it was obvious that prior to packing the board had been dropped on a corner which had then broken off  - revealing the chipboard and veneer! I immediately repacked the board then obtained a returns label and a refund.I'm rather cross as I purchased this board as a result of being misled by the advert and the 5-star reviews. Don't believe them! This is not a quality item. Nor do I like being palmed off with this rubbish. Â£33 is a lot of money for a square of thin chipboard covered in veneer! Don't touch it! "

Instead the liquid pours out of the tips when he draws, dripping down the boards and staining everything it comes into contact with when wet. It doesn't even give good coverage - when it comes into contact with a shiny surface it just separates like any normal paint would. After waiting ten minutes for it to dry on the whiteboard I eventually gave up and wiped it off still wet, only to find it had stained the board. I also got some of the blue on my fingers when I was cleaning it off and have walked around looking like a smurf for two days. Tried them on paper and they dried quickly, but he can use crayons for that. Really can't understand the good reviews for these unless I've got a faulty batch. They're going straight back! "

 on 17 July 2014 "," These new ""improved"" engines are pretty poor. Yes, they are faster, but due to the changed drive wheels - the tread is more spaced out, formed of little spikes - the new engines can't pull many carriages. Worse, they can't go over the flexi track or the straight pieces of track designed to be used in stations. There just isn't enough friction between the new wheels and those types of track since the surface of the track is smoother. Gordon does work fine on the standard track, but my son always uses flexi track and stations in the tracks he builds.I have a very disappointed 4 year old (he'd been saving his stickers for a while to get Gordon) and would advise against buying any of these new engines. We won't be getting any more until/unless the design fault is rectified. "

 on 14 Jun. 2015 "," I purchased a number of these when they were reduced at at local supermarket. Nearly all of them are now broken. The basic skeleton parts are made from quite a rigid plastic and the ends that clip, are easily broken. The problem appears to be that the ball end joints are quite stiff and difficult to move. When these parts are forced it tranfers the load onto the rigid plastic clip end of the joint causing them to fracture and break.  My son isn't rough with his toys, he usually keeps them toys in their robot form and just uses them as dolls which he wants me to 'make them talk' for him. When he wants them to be transformed he gets me to do it so I know that none of the toys have been forced. These toys are just made from a material that is just not fit for use and Hasbro should not have released a toy that is broken so easily. I have tried to contact hasbro to get replacement parts which I would have been happy to pay for if necessary, just so my son can play with them again. As yet I have had no responce. "

In schools time is taught via the quarter and half hour and most importantly o'clock. This game however refers to 7.00am or 8.30pm which is completely different. It's also possible to play the game without any reference to telling the time by just matching the picture on the card to the picture on the board so children don't have to tell the time at all and it becomes just a normal lotto game. It would be lovely to see a game which actually deals with telling the time in a way that children would learn.

Metallic suggest a shiny bright finish to the product that reflects light.The *silver* is grey.  The *gold* is flesh colour - almost the same as a normal rubber band.Upon closer inspection of the pictures, when you zoom in, the pictures do reflect the real colour, although it seems to be a lot brighter.  The normal picutre without the zoom looks a lot brighter than the loom bands actually are.If you are looking for 600 grey and flesh coloured loom bands, these are ideal.If you are looking for 600 metallic gold and silver loom bands, these are NOT ideal at all.Purchase with care.  The product has been given 2 stars due to the poor description.  Had it been accurately described, and ordered based on that, it would rate much higher.On a side note, the delivery was on time, and the product was well packaged. "

I'm sorry, but you can't tell me that 3 packs of hamma beads cost over Â£5 to post to me!!!!Amazon related companies; please think before you charge for postage and packaging on multiple orders placed by one customer from a single account at one time.If a customer is ordering more than one item from you; surely you need to adjust the postage and packaging prices appropriately without asking whether it is an order for a school or for other purposes?  The postage and packaginmg that this company charged was blatantly unfair.  They have offered to refund in return for my removal of negative feedback - but I would have preferred more thought and customer care at the outset. "

If they aren't metallic gold but caramel in colour, they should be clearly listed as such and to this effect I am placing this feedback on Amazon to prevent other people having the same disappointment.

These 3 bladed ones look the part and as they say are really very quiet, they cut down on the whine. However there is a downside, on my CX10C and also on my CX10A the battery life is cut from around 3-4 mins to about a minute. The quality is good enough but do you want to be limiting your flights to that short a period. They do look nice for display though, so if you have the cash to spare, give them a try.

 on 8 Oct. 2007 "," I own pretty much every yu-gi-oh deck released, and i have to say this is comfortably the worst.Very defense minded,these cards are never going to cause any real damage to your opponent, except deflected dmage when they attack your face downs. Even in defense the lower level cars hold nothing more special than 2000, which is on par with the likes of Mystic Elf and Island Turtle.Yes Exodd master of the guard does have 4000 defense, but this is never going to win a duel for you. The only card that saves this deck from being a complete washout is the mighty Megarock dragon, powered up by 700 for every earth monster taken out of play but its own effect!And it is classed as a special summon! Too weak for my liking with basic cards such as shield and sword duplicated, would best be used when combined with an attacking biased deck such as Dinosaur's rage or my personal favorite Machine Revolt (Ignores trap cards and some spell).

After leaving them with the florist, I got a phone call from them advising that as these balloons are made of latex they would only stay up for about 12 hours. I purchased a Helium canister and blew them all up the night before, the wedding was at 10.30am so we did not have time to blow them up on the day. Unfortunately most of the balloons were laying on the table when we arrived at the reception. This is a shame as they are very pretty. I was really disappointed that the table didn't look as good as it should have done.

Vastly overpriced and obviously reliant on a current craze, I honestly thought it was akin to something you would think twice about buying from a pound shop.The item came well packed but, the box it was in appeared to have kicked around the warehouse floor before actually finding its way in to the packaging.The ""glitter"" doesn't shimmer, sparkle or do anything in particular to justify its inclusion. I expected something like the old ""snowstorm"" paperweights that you used to shake, but the foil cut outs only decide to move very slowly upwards once it is held upside down and then fall equally slowly back to the feet again when turned upright. Shaking it does absolutely nothing to increase the movement and whoever designed it obviously did not have the time or inclination to carry out any serious research.I have given it two stars because my granddaughter appeared to like it although I did not see her actually play with it for long. For me it's less than one star, but then again I am someone who (probably unrealistically) expects a bit of thought and effort to go into things - even if they are ""only"" for children - rather than profiteering from the ""tat"" that this seems to be.

We really wanted to like Patchi and add him to our growing dinosaur collection unfortunately; within minutes his bottom jaw had broken off. Now that's bad enough when you're dealing with an excited little child who has been looking forward to the toy for weeks but, even before the jaw fell off, she was so disappointed with Patchi. He's credited as being a 'walking talking' dinosaur - he's not. Patchi is jointed in six different areas (legs, kneck and mouth) allowing for strictly limited, stiff movements.

The hammer, file and screwdriver seem fine, but we will now have to invest in proper tools to make sure the saw doesn't come apart whilst it's being used...

I love the size of it too.I bought this a present for someone else but as others reported that theirs arrived broken, so I opened it when it arrived and found one of the head lamps broken off and missing. It's not in the box so it must have been packed like that, which means I'm going to have to give someone a present that is not complete which sucks. And the stripes down the sides feel very flimsy and you can tell that they are going to break off quickly even with careful handling.Such a weird combination of quality and cheap finishes.As others have said, for the cost you would expect the doors to open at the very least. Or have the boys weapons on the seat, something that made it obvious that it was from the show and not just a regular Impala. With just a tiny bit more effort, this could have been a fantastic product. If they remade this product with those features I would buy one for myself in a heartbeat. "

I had read some reviews that you have to keep building the track as it comes apart easily. I think that depends on if your child is heavy handed or not, i havent had to keep putting it back together but i could see that if a child was a bit heavy handed then you would be up and down all the time. I have taught my 2 year old to try and put it back together on her own and she can mangae to do some bits but does force them together if they are round the wrong way, but time will cure that. Overall yes im glad i got it for her and i dont regret buying it, there are better products out there or might be just worth getting them the trains on there own. "

VINE VOICE on 27 Aug. 2006 "," The Saga line continues with the Anakin Skywalker (Battle Of Coruscant) figure. Collector's will immediately recognise this as a reissue of the Revenge Of The Sith #2 Anakin from 2005 but this time the figure comes with a nice cloth cloak.He also comes with a blue lightsabre, lightsabre handle, alternate right hand and hologram figure. The detailing is quite good and the poesability is excellent although he tends to fall over forwards quite easily.One of the few good Anakin figures and a nice addition to any set. "

Batcave review ,3.0, 7 Jan. 2012 ," By

 on 7 Jan. 2012 "," We bought this for our 4 year old son for Christmas although I actually got it when it was on offer at Â£31.99 in September. I agree with another reviewer in that this is a fair price for it. I don't think it's worth paying more than about Â£50 for it and can't believe it's actually on sale at Â£128.00 as I'm writing this.We have quite a few bits from Imaginext and although this is a great toy we've encountered a problem with the lift winding mechanism almost as soon as my son started playing with it which has meant the lift doesn't work properly. I would have brushed this off as a one off however we have the fire station set as well and the fire engine hose obviously works on the same system and that stopped working quite quickly too. I think we can fix the lift issue with a bit of DIY repair work but it's still annoying to have to do it. But it is still a fun toy*****Update*****After contacting Mattel about the lift problem and getting an unsatisfactory reply and no idea how to fix it I researched it online and found lots of people have had the same problem.. For anyone else who has this problem it can be fixed relatively easily once you know how! Unscrew the screws that hold the red bit into the reel and the ones that attach it to the main structure but not the screws that keep the black reel together. Wind the string around the black reel twice so it's very taut and then get it back in place and screwed in without the string coming out again. And hey presto, a working lift!! I did think I was going to go crazy though trying to do it so I'm keeping my stars at 3. "
Another Missed Opportunity By Character Options ,3.0, 27 July 2014 ," By

 on 27 July 2014 "," Once again Character Options have missed a trick but let's start with the positives. The 'pilot' dalek is wonderfully detailed with the unique colouring of the black/grey head & intermittent side panels plus it is fully posable which surprised me for a 3.75"" figure. The firing canon is extremly powerful & the whole thing looks quite splendid in it's exploded view. Now onto the negatives. This is supposed to be a replica of the Patrol Ships used in the Time War & the panels extended open are supposed to close to make one huge dalek protecting it's pilot which would have looked great ... it doesn't ... you are stuck with it in the exploded view which sort of defeats the object. The panels pop off far too easily (just a plastic ball joint holds them in place) & I can foresee after a few months of removing & replacing them they will simply become loose & fall off. The projectile that fits into the firing cannon is so obviously plastic (the colour dosen't help) it spoils the overall look of the model. Another failing is that on the interior floor of the Patrol Ship are two little slots that the pilot daleks side wheels fit into to hold it in position. The problem is where they are situated because once you place the pilot in position his plunger arm extends beyond the control panel to operate the ship so how is he supposed to work the controls? Little details like this frustrate me & show how little thought or care was put into the design. In a child's hands this would probably not last more than a few days, maybe a couple of weeks if you are really lucky so I am completely confused as to who their target market is ...Read more â€º "

 on 5 Jan. 2014 "," My three year old daughter loves this toy and I love it too because the beads and all the other items in the high quality box are not likely to choke my 1 year old son. It's also wonderful to have a set which includes example lacing sequences for my daughter to follow, a bit more of a challenge than simply lacing in any order at all.However, there's one big problem with the product I received...the box contains three sticks (a bit like knitting needles) which can be used for lacing onto something like a rod. One of the three sticks we received is too wide to fit into the hole in the stand. So it's completely useless. My daughter can only use two of the three sticks, which means that the game is over much more quickly.  Very disappointing.Amazon issued me a 20% refund, which I feel is less than we are due as the product is 33% defective.A great toy, but defective. "

 on 17 Dec. 2014 "," This card is v good quality, nice and thick.  However I've only given it 3 stars because it doesn't go through the printer v well at all.  Whilst it prints colours okay, because of its thickness the rollers have trouble gripping it so it slips which means all my designs come out completely in the wrong place (i.e. too near the edge or sometimes off the page).  I've used 300gsm hammered card before with no problems but I'm guessing this one must have some coating on it that my printer doesn't like.  Shame, because it is really good quality card.  If you're using it to fold and embellish, rather than print on, then it would be perfect. "

TOP 500 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 27 July 2014 "," My four year old cabin boy pirate grandson was staying for the night and in the morning I left  it out and found him unusually quiet and engaged with the project. He spent over an hour humming happily to himself as he decorated both sides of the card scenes. He dressed and undressed the pirates, sent them off to the desert island, manned the pirate ship against raiders and really enjoyed the fun to be had.Later on when his cousin arrived, he proudly showed the scenes to him, then there was more fiddling and placing the figures. By lunchtime the set was exasperating, they 'res useable stickers' would not stay on, they fell off the board and generally misbehaved. What a shame.I was going to compare this set to the old fashioned fuzzy felt scenes I used to  play with, and so you'd think a modern version would be new and improved. However - this set is purely a couple of plays and in the bin, an ideal stocking filler to keep a three or four year old amused for a spell but no more.A lot of thought has gone into the art work and design, the jolly colours are really attractive and appealing, they just didn't give much thought to the sticky stuff!

Most of the paint detail on the car come in the form of a sheet of stickers which have to be attached at home. Iâ€™m not sure why Scalextric donâ€™t do this themselves as some are pretty fiddly to fix to the car - and without the aid of pictures with the exception of those on the box itâ€™s not clear where most of them go.More importantly, the Amazon description is incorrect. This car is not Digital Plug Ready. Part of the confusion may arise as Scalextric have a â€˜Car Features Icon Guideâ€™ on the side of the box which lists many features which can come with a Scalextric car - including DPR, working front lights, working rear lights etc. This does not mean this model comes with those. To establish that you have to look as the icons displayed on the front of the box.In use the car, as the â€˜lightningâ€™ moniker suggests, is fast. Largely thatâ€™s because itâ€™s very light indeed. As a result it leaves the track with ease.Overall not one of Scalextric best efforts. Three starsâ€¦just. "

"Fantastic Minifigures, Awesome Play Value, Rubbish Build. ",3.0, 1 Mar. 2016 ," By
    
    Mr. Ba Corbett-mills
  
 on 1 Mar. 2016 "," As a LEGO and DC fan I often pick up the full range of sets (If I can afford them) and it's great to see a cheap support set for the Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice movie. However, this set doesn't really stand true to the quality I've come to expect even from these smaller sets where there are obviously limitations on the designer.I feel a good effort has been made to create a scene from the movie and some great play features have been incorporated, but that for all intents and purposes this is a very loosely put together mash of bricks. It feels like something a child would make themselves when trying to recreate said scene - which of course is cool for kids and does encourage expansion of the scene in play.On the other hand, you do get two excellent minifigures, armored Batman is fantastic and although it's a shape the 'armor' section covers some really intricate detailing on the figures torso he looks awesome overall. As a plus the glowing elements used on the head are great and really represent the armored suit so well. Superman is fairly standard but it's great to see both main characters from the movie in such an easy to purchase set.Overall this is worth picking up for the minifigures alone, but don't expect an exciting build or an awesome display item as it doesn't hold up so much on that end. Buying for kids though, then this will be a winner as the play value is huge! "

Good introduction to model railways ,4.0, 16 Oct. 2014 ," By
    
    S. P. Long
  
TOP 500 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 16 Oct. 2014 "," This is a pretty decent starter set as a first step into model railways.You get a very nice detailed model of the Gloucester City and its tender, and three equally well-detailed model coaches. The locomotive is DCC-ready. (DCC is the digital control system for model railways allowing different trains to run at different speeds o the same tracks - DCC-ready indicates that the loco has a socket into which a DCC module can be slotted in future; the controller provided with the set is not DCC-compatible.)As with all Hornby starter sets, there is sufficient track included for a simple oval circuit with a single siding and one set of points. Hornby points are a bit flimsy - they don't seem to click as positively into one side or the other as I remember those on the model railways of my youth doing, but the track is fine otherwise. The fishplates are reassuringly tight, and it all slots together easily. There is also a ""trackmat"" supplied, which is a rather grand name for a large printed sheet of glossy paper with a suggested layout, to make all of which requires you to buy rather a lot of extra track and accessories - more a piece of marketing than anything really useful.The supplied controller is a simple rheostat - you can turn the speed up and down and select forward or reverse, but it's all you need to get started. (If you get keen, you can buy a DCC module for the locomotive and a DCC controller to give more control options for a more sophisticated layout.)Putting it all together took 20 minutes or so - it's reasonably obvious how you assemble it all, which is fortunate as the supplied instructions are a bit sketchy. Not really a problem, as most bits will only fit one way!Read more â€º "

    Saltrampen
  
 on 20 Nov. 2013 "," I bought this Train set for my son and am a complete novice when it comes to Train sets.The Hornby set feels solid and attention is paid to the detail on the train. It comes with a mat, which is actually a giant printed poster. For the long term, a hard backing is needed.The track layout feels like it is the next size up from a basic layout as it already contains an extension pack.The train itself is not huge and looks silly pulling long  passenger carriages (as it would on a real train).It is quite expensive and had I not seen it at a reduced price, I probably would not have bought it (hence 4 / 5). The train can actually go quite fast in both directions. As novice I have discovered several features that must be well known to train set enthusiasts:The Trains can be tricky to get all wheels on the track. (I think there is an accessory to help with this)Big Long carriages do not like tight bends at speed (they come off).When using points to guide the train onto an inner circuit (I bought more track) you need to get jumper leads from Hornby and these are not included in Extension packs A & B.Without these the train loses power, but I think they are relatively cheap.The Track needs to be cleaned with a cloth, as any grease / dirt can stop the power to the trainTrain track has to be carefully aligned when joining one section to another, so continually putting it away and getting it out is time consuming - setting it up on a hard backing is a better solution.My child is very careful with the set and its contents, but not an ideal present for kids who leave it lying around and step on it (the carriages are expensive). I can see why people like train sets and this is a good introductory set with the plethora of accessories and trains etc from Hornby  and others we were left wanting to buy more bits and pieces (such as electric rather than manual points) after using this set.

These faults can , however , be rectified with care and despite this , the basic kit has been the basis over the years for countless , motorised , working  models . Not only can the kit be used to build a GWR 'City' class loco but determined 'kitbashers' can use it as the basis for several broadly similar GWR classes from the early years of the twentieth century .

Looks as good as a ready-to-run model. Easy click together build. ,4.0, 27 Feb. 2015 ," By
    
    T. Scharf
  
 on 27 Feb. 2015 "," Just built one of these! The body is self coloured in the right colour and the sides are lined out and lettered. The ends need to be painted black. Apart from the roof ventilators (which can be glued inside the roof) the whole kit clicks together ingeniously. It took about 10 mins to assemble this kit and the next will take more like 4 minutes. The only transfers/decals are the round LMS logos you can see in the centre.I don't agree with the assembly instructions! The body comprises sides ends and floor in a single piece. There is a rectangular cutout in the floor for the metal weight. I would fit the interior seat moulding into the body first. There is very little space between the compartment walls and the side of the coach to feed the flush-glaze window strips in. (They can't go in first) Particularly on the 2nd window strip I was concerned that I might overstretch the coach side at the end and make the plastic go milky. I was relieved when the glazing clicked into the windows. At that point, with the windows correctly in place, the corridor connections can be slid in the ends and the underframe offered up to the body (upside down with the metal weight located). The underframe latches actually click into the window strips to tie it all together. Likewise the roof clicks onto tabs on the window strips. Ingenious!Assembling and fitting the bogies was quite easy. The coupling retainers were fiddly though. Each coupling is plastic with a black metal hook. One of the hooks fell off. There is a C shape feature which clips onto a plastic bar and I needed to crunch it slightly with pliers, then adjust outwards with a screwdriver again until it clicked into place. The hook doesn't lift and drop as freely as it should now. It's on account of that and not being able to build the coach in the assembly instruction order (without feeling I was going to break something) that I've docked a star."

 on 24 Aug. 2010 "," The interactive Chuggington is a brilliant idea. However I was left a little dissapointed. I was under the impression each chugger interacted with each other automatically. This is not so, you have to continually press the horn of each chugger and then they will interact and comment on what is around them i.e tunnell, chugwash etc....This is ok for older children who have grasped the idea and know what to do. But for younger children it reverts to a push along train and in effect is no different from the die-cast edition. I know as my child gets older he will develop his play but I feel a little mis-led by the concept. I have also had to return the action chugger as the paint on the wings was peeling. I have asked for a replacement however as action chugger is the main man in our household! Enjoy! "

A good safe toy for infants to play with.  Recommended. ,4.0, 15 April 2015 ," By
    
    Antony Dalton
  
 on 15 April 2015 "," A very good train set and very popular with the young infants in my family (from 2-5 years old).  The range of layouts that you can build is good and the pieces are easy to assemble even for little ones.  Both trains run well in the tracks.  The wood is a good fine grain that does not splinter easily, and is well finished, so is safe for children to handle.  It is also quite robust.  A couple of minor issues.  The track supports for the elevated section are rather too narrow and can fall over easily.  If they were a square section they would be more stable and support the elevated pieces much better.  This can be remedied by cutting duplicate supports and glueing them together to make the square cross section.  Also a couple of extra pieces to act as joining pieces would help add yet more variety to the layout designs.  One that is needed is another double hole joint and the other a double plug connector.  Nevertheless overall it is a highly recommended product that can keep youngsters safely occupied for hours.  But for these minor failings I would have given it 5 stars. "

 on 24 Nov. 2013 "," Although the review title is positive I do have to start off with a small compliant. Although the package arrived and appeared to be well protected for some reason the front 4 wheels/bogey area was not connected up to the rest of the train and it took a while to figure out how to fix it on properly!That said, I think this is most likely an unlucky one off. The train set is good value for money (especially when compared to the crazy prices for the DCC already installed trains!), the locomotive and carriages appear to be of a very good standard and it runs excellently so far. No regrets in buying this at all!EDIT - I now have to add another negative point... though it has a happy ending. After a day or so the locomotive stuttered and stopped. It had occurred to me while it was running that it sounded a little rough compared to what it should sound like but the stoppage was quite sudden... though it did get going again it was stuttering still. If you come across this apply some small amounts of machine oil to the areas mentioned in the maintenance guide that comes with this train set and then try and running it for a few minutes and it should return to normal!

If she still won't speak then change the batteries (3 x AAA).Binky's interactive and will chat to the other 'join in and play' characters. Sit Binky and friends close together, press a paw or squeeze their tummy and off they go. The toys are sensitive enough they know which of their interactive friends are close by and call one another by name. Only two in the group will speak though. They don't all talk at the same time.The more toys you have in the series the more phrases they use and the longer they chat. Unfortunately, they don't say much and each one has just a short series of phrases which they repeat over and over. They also don't have any facial movement and though their voices are slightly different there's no way of telling who's saying what unless you're really close by.It's worth bearing in mind their plush fabric can't be washed because of the battery pack.

 on 7 Jan. 2013 "," I bought two of these Steiff teddies for Christmas - one for a 1 year old and the other for a 2 year old.The girls seem to love them as they are small and very cuddly like a plush toy. But beware - I hadn't really appreciated how small 18cms is, so was disappointed when they arrived. So while they're probably a good size for small children they may not be so great for older ones.The other disappointing thing was the packaging - or lack of it. The teddies were in plastic bags (good idea while in a warehouse), so I had to find more suitable packaging (boxes) for presentation.I'm trusting Steiff to have produced something that's robust (my 29 year old still has his, which he was given at 1 year old), rather than just a collectors item - hence the 5 stars for durability. Only time will tell.I've marked ""fun"" and ""educational"" with 3 stars because a teddy probably doesn't deliver either of these in comparison to other toys.But it's a nice bear, well made and begs to be cuddled.

 on 1 Dec. 2015 "," We first purchase the 32cm version from Amazon which was nothing like the photo shown either on Amazon or the Seiff website where the photo seems to be the same one for both sizes of bear. It looked smaller, thinner and not so attractive. We returned it immediately for an instant refund from Amazon which was very swift and efficiently handled.Having done a lot more research online we finally decided to order the 40cm version from Amazon not quite sure what weâ€™d get.What we got was a better balanced and cuddly bear (than the 32cm) which was closer to the one shown in the photo, but looked like heâ€™d grown up a bit. (see my photos) I can only think that the photo shown of Elmar on the Stiff and Amazon website is of an earlier version. The proportions are all wrong, most noticeably the eyes on the latest version are smaller, that said he is adorable and will be cherished by our new grandson. It just would be nice if he'd matched the picture.There are a number of comments about if the versions shown on Amazon are genuine as they come in a plastic bag, well they are, tagged and individually numbered so I have no doubt genuine Stiff. If you want the box (which doesnâ€™t seem very exciting and is worth Â£3.95) buy your bear direct from Steiff.Overall height of bear sitting is 29cm, something we couldnâ€™t find out anywhere.Also both the 32cm and 40cm versions have a bulge at the top of his neck, which apparently is normal.

The unit is much better than the previous version as there are 2 platforms in which the letters sit. The side with more letters are better for the kids as they can spot more words.A simple shake of the unit to jiggle the letters up activates the battery powered timer...saves the bother of someone watching an egg timer!!After 3 minutes the unit constantly flashes to inform players that the time is up.Educationally this is pleasing. It certainly enhances those literature skills especially for children (although not particularly KS1 ages). The unit is fairly compact and not too bulky either therefore it's easily stored away when not in use.Just be careful not to lose any of the cubed letters!!8 out of 10.

These dice are brightly coloured and feel like they will last for a long time. I will always know where to go when one of the other board games is missing its dice !

Some of the numbers on the other colour dice don't exactly look amazing either but most are pretty good.Overall you get what you pay for and for the price, I'm happy with them.

This dome comes with 5 dice, it doesn't feel expensively made  and it isn't but it does the job really well.  The dome is plastic and we removed the yellow privacy cover straight away (the cover is for gambling games I think).  The dome just lifts off so you can put your own dice in or do what we did and take 4 out.  Once  you put the batteries in (2 x aaa) away you go.The dome doesn't ""punch"" or flick the dice into the air like a Ludo clicker but at the press of the tiny button the green disc that the dice sit on spins and tumbles the dice. Brilliantly simple and effective.

TOP 50 REVIEWER on 12 Mar. 2014 "," This is an excellent HO scale diorama piece comprising of a white enclosed coach, with a pair of white horses, and two figures on the (red) driving seat dressed in a grey livery. One is a man in a grey greatcoat and top hat, the other is a female in a grey coat or uniform jacket and grey jockey-style of cap. There do not appear to be figures inside, but if you look through the back window, these are heads visible. This is a striking model, and would be an excellent decoration for almost any diorama.As you would expect from Preiser, these figures are of a high quality of manufacture, detail and colouring. Note that I originally paid Â£20 for my set, so it pays to shop around in your local model shops â€“ or even a distant one. I live in London, but find it worth travelling as far as Faversham in Kent to the Hobby Shop there for my models."

 on 9 July 2011 "," Got these for my 2 yr old - he's obsessed with trains and loves these characters. They are pretty tough so have survived some bashing. Only thing is that he can't get them to attach to each other with the ball/ socket joint, it's a bit fiddly so I have to help with that (repeatedly as they do come apart quite easily!) However, this won't be an issue as he gets older. Only got Brewster and Wilson this time to see how he got on, but think I will be getting the track and Koko for xmas as he plays with these for ages and loves talking to them (not sure he realises the trains talk to each other, he just thinks they talk to him... could be setting myself up for years of counselling with that :) "

As I will be building the model railway in stages I wanted something to get me started and the single track contoller was ideal.  It didn't take me long to get it conected which is simple. I found it to be very smooth and I could maintain any speed, even very slow speeds without a problem and it would just run at that speed for as long as needed.  I will in due course buy a Gaugemaster multi track controller but this is ideal for what I need at this time.

Easy to set-up, just assign 2x 2 digit accessory addresses from your DCC controller ( Each signal head is commanded independently ) and its ready to use. Full instructions included along with a ladder & sign plate to add even more realism if you so wish.  I have the Hornby E-link & Railmaster system and these work perfectly with it. Other types of signal are also available with single heads, distant & Home types. The real benefit of these signals is that because they are wire-free you can move them on your lay-out quickly if you change your mind or layout, so worth the extra cost compared with regular signals. plus they are LED for a long life.

 on 8 Oct. 2015 "," Good little train set, something different to the normal with having a crane.The crane is the normal Hornby Breakdown crane, which you can get in a 'steam era' rusty colour or modern painted yellow.  This one is red with a British Rail symbol on the side (like from the 1980s). Of course, that doesn't match with steam train (a few decades out!); but this being a beginners train set that won't matter most young children (just be careful if your recipient is very clued up on these things!). The crane is weighted so it won't tip over when used to lift derailled trucks and wagons.  Add on winders are plugged in to operate the hook and crane height. Excellent pulley mechanism for raising the crane arm.The train has a plain colour scheme, like a general shunting train, as if it were one of many of the same kind. Almost gave it 4 stars because of this, but it's low priced so it stays at 5.The controller, track, wagon are all the usual good Hornby quality.Excellent small starter trainset, especially if you want to do more than just watch a train go round and round.....

 on 8 Aug. 2014 "," These ex-LNER Gresley teak-bodied buffet cars, built in the 1930's, survived long enough to receive all three British Railways coach liveries, crimson and cream, maroon (in which this model is also currently available) and finally the blue and grey depicted here used from the mid-1960's.  I've given this one 5* as opposed to the maroon one's 4* as in my opinion it looks much better in this blue and grey livery.  The reviews are virtually the same apart from that rating.  Presumably they lasted so long as a new buffet car cost much more than a new ordinary coach to build. It's stated on the Net that the last one was withdrawn in 1977 from Western Region use as W9135E, whilst the one depicted here, E9131E, lasted only until 1974.This model is up to the usual standard of recent Hornby coaches and, whilst a scale person wouldn't fit into the gap between the seats and tables, you must peer in through the windows to appreciate the best interior detail. It's a lovely little bar/counter complete with chrome edging, an (empty) transparent sandwich display case, what looks like a chrome coffee-maker and one of those metal foot-rests running the length of the bar/counter complete with the little pegs that hold it above floor level. No stools though, presumably to encourage folks to buy the curly sandwiches, over-priced drinks and then bog off back to their seats leaving it clear for more punters to part with their hard-earned.There's also a representation of the hand-rails at the windows by the buffet bar/counter to hold onto going over the points at junctions (or after a few expensive tinnies (which is all they used to have (and still do as far as I'm aware) in the beers department.Read more â€º "

TOP 50 REVIEWER on 31 May 2014 "," This is a finely-detailed HO-scale model of a Bavarian Sate Railways (Epoch 1) baggage/post wagon in the standard epoch 1 green livery, with a grey-green roof. It is a short four-wheeled vehicle with smooth flat sides, and two end platforms. Some internal detail can be seen through the windows. The running number is Munchen PpostL 21029.This model is fitted with the standard â€˜loopâ€™ style of coupling. It is packaged in the current standard Trix card box with a transparent window with the usual transparent plasticky internal packaging, but with only a base and two folding-up end-pieces, no top.This is a beautifully detailed model, as you would expect from Trix, with some fine details already in place, but there is a packet of delicate bits for you to add. It is of a high quality of manufacture.Note that I paid Â£32 for my model, so it is worth shopping around in your local model shops â€“ or even a distant one."

TOP 50 REVIEWER on 22 Mar. 2014 "," This is an excellent HO scale diorama piece comprising of a long wooden wagon with a seated driver and various sacks inside, and with two horses hauling it. This is an interesting and finely-detailed model, and would be an excellent decoration for a farm or country scene.As you would expect from Preiser, these figures are of a high quality of manufacture, detail and colouring. Note that I originally paid Â£14 for my set, so it pays to shop around in your local model shops â€“ or even a distant one. I live in London, but find it worth travelling as far as Faversham in Kent to the Hobby Shop there for my models."

 on 24 Nov. 2015 "," Excellent model in perfect condition from reputeable amazon seller, however it was returned for a refund because it's couplings were not compatable with my other Railjet coaches. I was previously ignorant of the fact that Roco Railjet coaches with internal lighting do not have the same couplings as those without. Roco Railjet coaches 64722 / 64723 / 64724 have internal lighting powered through connections in the couplings."

His Wakes were held yearly during August Bank Holiday and were the highlight of summer. These beautiful traction engines were then always used to power the rides and alongside fairground organs are pure nostalgia!

 on 30 April 2011 "," I bought this for my 2 year old grandson and he loves it so much. I have also bought him others in the series. They are very strong toys due to being die cast and do take a lot of banging and bumping about during play, without damage to their paintwork.My grandson is obsessed with rescue scenarios at the moment and loves to bring Kevin in to help if James crashes. The fact that James talks too enthralls him. He get's so excited everytime he gets a new engine, as he wants to hear what it sounds like. He has to date..Thomas, Spencer, Percy, Diesel, Toby,and some other's. He has Bertie bus and a small Harold too.It's great they have magnets too which means all the engines can pull each other and their tender's. He likes to swap them all about and put them all together in a long line. This is one of the toys I've seen him having the most pleasure from so far. He plays contentedly for hours with these engines, making up his own scenarios.I have more of these put away for him, and have just given him Spencer which he again loved.One little comment, I wish it was made plain in Amazon's product details which ones talk and don't. Which are die cast etc, I find myself sometimes going through products for an age, or going to other sites, to make sure I have the right one.Sometimes a search for talking brings up non talking in the mix as well. Not a major point and not a dig at Amamzon as I use them constantly and I'm always pleased with the service, but it would make shopping for these quicker and easier. Brilliant toys all round, great fun and kids love them. "
